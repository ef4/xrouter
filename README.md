xrouter
==============================================================================

Home for Ember Polaris Routing experimentation.

## Contributing

`yarn start` at the top of the monorepo will run both the addon's Rollup-based build and the test-app in parallel.

Alternatively, you can run either by themselves via `yarn start` in the appropriate directory.

## Organization

```
.
├── xrouter: a v2 addon
└── test-app: an Embroider-based test application that exercises the addon
